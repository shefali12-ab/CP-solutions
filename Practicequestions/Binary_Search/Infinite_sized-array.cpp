//Given an infinite sized array, we need to write an efficient solution to search an element, if element is present then we need to return the index of element otherwise return -1 if element is not found
/* Naive solution
traversing the array as soon as we find the element we return its index and if element prsent in array become greater then the element that we need to find we return -1;
In online coding contest the size of array will be given in millions for infinite sized array.
