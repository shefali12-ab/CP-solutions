//search an element in a sorted and rotated array.
//sorted rotated array means array is sorted and we can rotate it counterclockwise any number of times and you may don't rotate it at all.
// arr[]={10, 20, 30, 40, 50,8,9} this array is rotated 2 times
// element=30 ,o/p=2
// arr[]={100,200,300,10,20} this array is rotated 2 times
// element=40 ,o/p=-1
